"""
Unified Learning Brain - Single function that defines ALL learning logic

This replaces the scattered approach with ONE canonical function that:
- READ mode: inference only (for API calls)
- WRITE mode: full update (for consumer)
- SIMULATION mode: for experiments and validation

Everything calls THIS ONE function - no more scattered logic!

🔥 BRAIN GOVERNANCE:
- JT (Objective Function) is the TOP-LEVEL CONTROL SIGNAL
- All adaptive behavior ultimately serves to maximize JT
- CONTROL variables: η, exploration, policy, ensemble weights
- STATE variables: mastery, uncertainty, ZPD, transfer (inform CONTROL)
- OBSERVE variables: metrics, regret, traces (dashboard/research only)
- PHASE 5 JT-AWARE POLICY: Policy selection maximizes expected future ΔJT
  - Old: STATE → POLICY (heuristic selection)
  - New: expected future ΔJT → POLICY (constitutional optimization)
  - Policies become governance instruments, not teaching styles
  - This makes policy temporally self-consistent with bandit/ensemble/η
- PHASE 6 CONSTITUTIONAL PURIFICATION: Remove hidden motivational priors
  - Old: policy_multiplier = hardcoded priors (hcie=1.12, heuristic=1.05, static=1.0, random=0.97)
  - New: policy_multiplier = expected_JT (learned from governance history)
  - Removes embedded pedagogical ideology and makes policy purely JT-driven
  - All subsystems now serve JT, not independent objectives

See BRAIN_GOVERNANCE.md for the complete governance architecture
